# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
Welcome to my personal learning repository for Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java! This repository severs as my documentation and practice grounds as I study fundamental computer Science concepts.

About This Repository
This repository contains my impelentations, notes, and pratice problems as I work through various data structures and algorithms. Each implementation includes comments and explanations to reinforce my understanding.

Learning Goals
- Master fundamentals datastructures and their operations
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Practice algorithm problem-solving techniques
- Build a solid foundation for technical intervies
- Document my learning journey for future reference

I am using Visual studio code and JDK 22

Topics covered:
Data Structures
 - Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
 - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
 - Stacks and Queues
 - Hash Tables/Hash Maps
 - Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Red-Black)
 - Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
 - Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
 - Tries
 - Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

Algorithms

 - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
 - Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary, DFS, BFS)
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Greedy Algorithms
 - Divide and Conquer
 - Backtracking
 - Graph Algorithms 

 Progress Tracking: 
 I regularly update this repository with new implementations and improvements. 

 While this is primarily a personal learning repository, I welcome:
- Bug fixes and corrections
- Suggestions for improvements
- Additional test cases
- Alternative implementations
